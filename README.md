# Baseline Pixi Bunnymark

## [Live Demo](https://dakom.github.io/baseline-pixi-bunnymark)

Touch the screen to add bunnies. Lots of bunnies.

Based on the internal pixi test at https://github.com/pixijs/bunny-mark but simplified and stripped to a single scenario.

This is meant to be a baseline comparison for performance sacrifices in approaches to using pixi, not meant to test pixi itself.
